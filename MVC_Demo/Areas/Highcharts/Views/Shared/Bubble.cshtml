@*You need to add a reference to jQuery prior to referencing the highcharts javascript file*@

<script src="http://code.highcharts.com/highcharts.js"></script>

@*The highchart-more.js file contains definitions for additional chart types not available 
in the main highcharts.js file such as "bubble". You need to include this file if you
are using these types of charts*@
