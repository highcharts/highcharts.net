            <summary>
            When the series contains less points than the crop threshold, all points are drawn,  event if the points fall outside the visible plot area at the current zoom. The advantage of drawing all points (including markers and columns), is that animation is performed on updates. On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

            The approximate pixel width of each group. If for example a series with 30 points is displayed over a 600 pixel wide plot area, no grouping is performed. If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

This apparently shifts the data to the left. When the smoothed option is true, this is compensated for. The data is shifted to the middle of the group, and min and max values are preserved. Internally, this is used in the Navigator series. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

The advantage of drawing all points (including markers and columns), is that animation is performed on updates. On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

            <summary>
            When the series contains less points than the crop threshold, all points are drawn,  event if the points fall outside the visible plot area at the current zoom. The advantage of drawing all points (including markers and columns), is that animation is performed on updates. On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area.

The y axis will show percentage or absolute change depending on whether <code>compare</code> is set to <code>"percent"</code> or <code>"value"</code>. When this is applied to multiple series, it allows comparing the development of the series against each other.

            <summary>
            When the series contains less points than the crop threshold, all points are drawn,  event if the points fall outside the visible plot area at the current zoom. The advantage of drawing all points (including markers and columns), is that animation is performed on updates. On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

        <member name="P:Highsoft.Web.Mvc.Stocks.PlotOptionsLineDataGrouping.GroupPixelWidth">
            <summary>
            The approximate pixel width of each group. If for example a series with 30 points is displayed over a 600 pixel wide plot area, no grouping is performed. If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

            <summary>
            Normally, a group is indexed by the start of that group, so for example when 30 daily values are grouped into one month, that month's x value will be the 1st of  the month. This apparently shifts the data to the left. When the smoothed option is true, this is compensated for. The data is shifted to the middle of the group, and min and max values are preserved. Internally, this is used in the Navigator series. Defaults to <code>false</code>.

If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area.

If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

On the other hand, when the series contains more points than the crop threshold, the series data is cropped to only contain points that fall within the plot area. The advantage of cropping away invisible points is to increase performance on large series.  .

            The approximate pixel width of each group. If for example a series with 30 points is displayed over a 600 pixel wide plot area, no grouping is performed. If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.

            <summary>
            An array of data points for the series. The series object is expecting the points to be ordered from low to high.  The reason for this is to increase performance. While in many cases the data is fetched from a server, it's also more convenient to sort on the server and thereby save on client resources.    The points can be given in three ways:<ol><li>A list of numerical values. In this case, the numerical values will be interpreted as y values, and x values will be automatically calculated, either starting at 0 and incrementing by 1, or from <code>pointStart</code> and <code>pointInterval</code> given in the plotOptions. This option is not available for series types with more than one value per point, like area range or OHLC. Example:<pre>data: [0, 5, 3, 5]</pre> </li> <li><p>A list of arrays with two values. In this case, the first value is the x value and the second is the y value. If the first value is a string, it is applied as the name of the point, and the x value is incremented following the above rules.</p> <p>For series with more than one value per point, like range or OHLC, the arrays will be interpreted as <code>[x, low, high]</code> or <code>[x, open, high, low, close]</code>. In these cases, the X value can be skipped altogether to make use of <code>pointStart</code> and <code>pointRange</code>.</p> Example:<pre>data: [[5, 2], [6, 3], [8, 2]]</pre></li><li><p>A list of object with named values. In this case the objects arepoint configuration objects as seen under <a href="#point">options.point</a>.</p><p>Range series values are given by <code>low</code> and <code>high</code>, while candlestick/OHLC values are given by <code>open</code>, <code>high</code>, <code>low</code>, <code>close</code>.</p> Example:<pre>data: [{name: 'Point 1',color: '#00FF00',y: 0}, {name: 'Point 2',color: '#FF00FF',y: 5}]</pre></li> </ol><p> In turbo mode, when working with series longer than <a class="internal" href="#plotOptions.series.turboThreshold"> turboThreshold</a> (1000 points by default), only one- or two dimensional arrays of numbers are allowed. The first value is tested, and we assume that all the rest are defined the same way.</p><p>Note data must be sorted by X in order for the tooltip positioning and data grouping to work.</p>

If however the series contains so many points that the spacing is less than the  groupPixelWidth, Highcharts will try to group it into appropriate groups so that each is more or less two pixels wide. If multiple series with different group pixel widths are drawn on the same x axis, all series will take the greatest width. For example, line series have 2px default group width, while column series have 10px. If combined, both the line and the column will have 10px by default.  Defaults to <code>2</code>.
