		/// When a series contains a `data` array that is longer than this, theSeries class looks for data configurations of plain numbers or arrays ofnumbers. The first and last valid points are checked. If found, the restof the data is assumed to be the same. This saves expensive data checkingand indexing in long series, and makes data-heavy charts render faster.Set it to `0` disable.Note:- In boost mode turbo threshold is forced. Only array of numbers or two  dimensional arrays are allowed.- In version 11.4.3 and earlier, if object configurations were passed  beyond the turbo threshold, a warning was logged in the console and the  data series didn't render.
