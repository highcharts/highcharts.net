This is\nuseful for example for visualising an amount between two points in\ntime or in a certain sector of a polar chart.\n\nSince Highcharts 3.0.2, the point placement can also be numeric,\nwhere 0 is on the axis value, -0.5 is between this value and the\nprevious, and 0.5 is between this value and the next. Unlike the\ntextual options, numeric point placement options won't affect axis\npadding.\n\nNote that pointPlacement needs a [pointRange](#plotOptions.series.pointRange) to work. For column series this is\ncomputed, but for line-type series it needs to be set.\n\nFor the `xrange` series type and gantt charts, if the Y axis is a\ncategory axis, the `pointPlacement` applies to the Y axis rather than\nthe (typically datetime) X axis.\n\nDefaults to `undefined` in cartesian charts, `\"between\"` in polar\ncharts.","see":["[xAxis.tickmarkPlacement](#xAxis.tickmarkPlacement)"],"sample":{"value":"maps/plotoptions/heatmap-pointplacement/\n        Placement in heatmap","products":["highcharts","highstock"]},"samples":[{"name":"Between in a column chart","value":"highcharts/plotoptions/series-pointplacement-between/","products":["highcharts","highstock"]},{"name":"Numeric placement for custom layout","value":"highcharts/plotoptions/series-pointplacement-numeric/","products":["highcharts","highstock"]},{"name":"Placement in heatmap","value":"maps/plotoptions/heatmap-pointplacement/","products":["highcharts","highstock"]}],"type":{"names":["string","number"]},"since":"2.3.0","products":["highcharts","highstock","gantt"]},"meta":{"filename":"highcharts/js/parts/Series.js","line":1043,"lineEnd":1083},"children":{}},"pointRange":{"doclet":{"description":"The width of each point on the x axis.

In a\ncategory or treegrid axis, the [point names](#series.line.data.name)\nof the chart's series are used for categories, if a\n[categories](#xAxis.categories) array is not defined.","sample":{"value":"gantt/treegrid-axis/demo\n        Treegrid axis","products":["gantt"]},"samples":[{"name":"Logarithmic with minor grid lines","value":"highcharts/yaxis/type-log-minorgrid/","products":["highcharts"]},{"name":"Logarithmic with extension to emulate negative values","value":"highcharts/yaxis/type-log-negative/","products":["highcharts"]},{"name":"Treegrid axis","value":"gantt/treegrid-axis/demo","products":["gantt"]}],"default":{"value":"treegrid","products":["gantt"]},"defaultByProduct":{"highcharts":"linear","gantt":"treegrid"},"products":["highcharts","gantt"],"values":"[\"linear\", \"logarithmic\", \"datetime\", \"category\",\n            \"treegrid\"]","since":"1.0.0"},"meta":{"filename":"highcharts/js/parts/Axis.js","line":2077,"lineEnd":2101},"children":{}}}},"zAxis":{"doclet":{"description":"The Z axis or depth axis for 3D plots.\n\nSee the [Axis class](/class-reference/Highcharts.Axis) for programmatic\naccess to the axis.","sample":{"value":"highcharts/3d/scatter-zaxis-grid/\n        Z-Axis with styling","products":["highcharts"]},"samples":[{"name":"Z-Axis with Categories","value":"highcharts/3d/scatter-zaxis-categories/","products":["highcharts"]},{"name":"Z-Axis with styling","value":"highcharts/3d/scatter-zaxis-grid/","products":["highcharts"]}],"type":{"names":["*","Array.<*>"]},"extends":"xAxis","since":"5.0.0","products":["highcharts"],"exclude":["breaks","crosshair","lineColor","lineWidth","nameToX","showEmpty"]},"meta":{"filename":"highcharts/js/parts/Axis.js","line":3032,"lineEnd":3049},"children":{}}}
